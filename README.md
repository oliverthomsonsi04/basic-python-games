# Basic Python Games Collection

![Made with Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)

A collection of simple, classic command-line games written in Python. This repository is designed for beginners to learn basic programming concepts and for anyone looking for some simple coding fun!

## üéÆ About The Project

This repository contains a set of fundamental games that are excellent for demonstrating core programming principles, including:
*   User Input and Output
*   Loops and Conditionals
*   Functions
*   Random Number Generation
*   Basic Data Structures (Lists)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To play these games, you can either clone this repository and run the files individually, or simply copy the code for any game below and save it as a `.py` file on your computer.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3 installed on your system.
*   You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### How to Run

1.  Copy the code for the game you want to play.
2.  Save it to a file (e.g., `game.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the file, and run it with the command:
    ```sh
    python game.py
    ```

## üïπÔ∏è Game Codes

Here is the full source code for each game.

### 1. Number Guessing Game

The computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it.

```python
# Filename: number_guesser.py
import random

def guess_the_number():
    """A simple number guessing game."""
    
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
    guess = 0

    print("--- Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! ---")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # Main game loop
    while guess != secret_number:
        try:
            # Get user input
            guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            # Check the guess
            if guess < secret_number:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif guess > secret_number:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
            else:
                print(f"üéâ Good job! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts!")
        
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where input is not a number
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

# Run the game

2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
Play the classic hand game against a computer opponent.
Generated python
# Filename: rock_paper_scissors.py
import random

def rock_paper_scissors():
    """A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer."""
    
    options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    
    print("--- Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors! ---")

    while True:
        # Get user's choice
        user_choice = input("Choose rock, paper, or scissors (or 'quit' to exit): ").lower()

        if user_choice == "quit":
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break

        if user_choice not in options:
            print("Invalid choice. Please choose rock, paper, or scissors.")
            continue

        # Get computer's choice
        computer_choice = random.choice(options)
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")

        # Determine the winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
             (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
             (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
            print("You win! üéâ")
        else:
